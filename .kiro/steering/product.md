# Product Overview

LaWaF (Lattice Wannier Functions) is a Python package for constructing electron, phonon, magnon, and other Wannier functions. It provides a unified interface for downfolding electronic and vibrational structures from first-principles calculations.

## Key Features
- Build Wannier functions for electrons, phonons, and magnons
- Interface with multiple DFT codes: Siesta (via sisl), Abinit (via Anaddb), and Phonopy
- Lattice Wannier Function (LWF) construction and analysis
- Visualization and plotting capabilities for Wannier functions
- Support for supercell calculations and structure manipulation

## Target Users
Computational physicists and materials scientists working with:
- Electronic structure calculations
- Phonon calculations and lattice dynamics
- Magnetic systems and spin dynamics
- Wannier function analysis and tight-binding models
