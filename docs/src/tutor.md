#### Downfolding from Wannier90 Hamiltonian
Below is an example of how to use downfold an tight-binding Hamiltonian from Wannier90 output. 

We need to write a python script (e.g. downfold.py) to call the Downfolder. I'll explain the code line by line.

The W90 Hamiltonian is the spin down part for an SrMn$O_3$. The orginal wannier functions consist the O $2p$ and Mn $3d$ orbitals. We want to downfold the Hamiltonian to a two band Mn $e_g$ model.  

```python
from banddownfolder import W90Downfolder
import numpy as np


def main():
    # Read From Wannier90 output
    # The w90 output
    model = W90Downfolder(folder='./SMO_Wannier/',
                          prefix='abinito_w90_down')

    # Downfold the band structure.
    model.downfold(method='scdmk',
                   kmesh=(3, 3, 3),
                   nwann=2,
                   weight_func='Gauss',
                   mu=10.0,
                   sigma=3.0,
                   selected_basis=None,
                   anchors={(0, 0, 0): (12, 13)},
                   anchor_kpt = None,
                   use_proj=True,
                   exclude_bands=[],
                   write_hr_nc='Downfolded_hr.nc',
                   write_hr_txt='Downfolded_hr.txt')

    # Plot the band structure.
    model.plot_band_fitting(kvectors=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0, 0],
                                               [0.5, 0.5, 0], [0, 0, 0],
                                               [.5, .5, .5]]),
                            knames=['$\Gamma$', 'X', 'M', '$\Gamma$', 'R'],
                            supercell_matrix=None,
                            npoints=100,
                            efermi=None,
                            erange=None,
                            fullband_color='blue',
                            downfolded_band_color='green',
                            marker='o',
                            ax=None,
                            savefig='Downfolded_band.png',
                            show=True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

After running the script, we get the output of Wannier functions (in Downfolded_hr.txt and Downfolded_hr.nc) and the band structures of the orginal/downfolded Wannier functions as below.

![Downfolded_band](tutor.assets/Downfolded_band.png)

* Now we dig into the example script, we first import the module W90Downfolder:

  ```python
  from banddownfolder.downfolder import W90Downfolder
  import numpy as np
  ```

* Next we read the Wannier90 output, which is in the folder directory and the prefix of these outputs. Note that the W90 Hamiltonian file has a _hr in the prefix and we do not need to specify this.

  ```
  model = W90Downfolder(folder='./SMO_Wannier/',
                            prefix='abinito_w90_down')
  ```

* Next we can do the downfolding. 

  - The method is first performed for each k-point in a BZ, and the
  - There are two methods implemented: the scdm-k method and the projected Wannier function method. Both use the same set of parameters.  The parameters are below. 

  - There are three methods to specify the bands we need to build the wannier functions from. First is that we can give some anchor points, e.g. the band with index 12 and 13 at $\Gamma$, given as
 ```
  nwann=2,
  anchors={(0,0,0):(12,13)},
  selected_basis = None,
  anchor_kpt = None,
 ```

The second method is we could select the basis from the original Wannier functions. E.g. in this example we could select the two $e_g$ orbitals of Mn (indices 0 and 3).  Only one of the two method should be used. e.g.

```
  nwann=2,
  anchors=None
  selected_basis = [0,3],
  anchor_kpt = None,
```

   The third method is that we only give an anchor kpoint. It will then try to find the best fitting in the given energy weight function in the anchor-kpoint. e.g.

```
nwann=2,
anchor_kpt=(0,0,0),
anchors=None,
selected_basis=None
```
Note that the three methods cannot be used in the simutaneously. Therefore, the parameters for the ones not in used should be set by None (which are the defaults).

  - In addition to the anchor points or the selected_basis, a energy weight function can be specified to indicate where the band we need are located, given by the parameters weight_func, mu, and sigma. 


  â€‹	==Note==: All the indices are zero-based. 

  - We use a strategy to select the band by projecting to the anchor points. It can improve the disentanglement significantly if the energy weight function is not obvious. By setting use_proj to True we can enable it. 
  - The Hamiltonian can be outputted to txt and netcdf file. The latter is strongly recommended. But if the netcdf library is not easy to install in your environment, the txt file is also a good choice. By setting the parameter to None, the output is dis-activated. 

```

        Downfold the Band structure.
        The method first get the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in a Monkhorst-Pack grid from the model.
        It then use the scdm-k or the projected wannier function method to downfold the Hamiltonian at each k-point.
        And finally it Fourier transform the new basis functions(Wannier functions) from k-space to real space.
        The Hamiltonian can be written.

* After we get the downfolded model, we can compare the band structures to see if we get a reasonable result. 

  ```
  model.plot_band_fitting(kvectors=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0, 0],
                                                 [0.5, 0.5, 0], [0, 0, 0],

### Output

* Downfolded_Hr.txt file:

  The Hamiltonian is outputed to a txt file. The hamiltonian is in real space, given in the form of $H(i,j,R)$.  There are interactions between orbitals in the neighboring unitcells, threrefore we need a $R$ vector to specify the cells of the orbital $j$.   $H(i,j,R)$ is the hopping term between the $i$th Wannier function in the original cell and the $j$th Wannier function in the cell. The on-site energy for orbital $i$ is  H(i,i,R=(0,0,0))  The header of the file contains the number of the cells (Number of R). The number of Wannier functions in the downfolded model. 

  In the Hamiltonian, the H(i,j, R) are grouped by the $R$ vectors.

```
Number_of_R: 27
Number_of_Wannier_functions: 2
Hamiltonian:
============================================================
index of R: 0.  R = [-1 -1 -1]
R = [-1 -1 -1], i = 0, j=0 :: H(i,j,R)= 0.0036+0.0000j
R = [-1 -1 -1], i = 0, j=1 :: H(i,j,R)= -0.0000-0.0000j
R = [-1 -1 -1], i = 1, j=0 :: H(i,j,R)= -0.0000+0.0000j
R = [-1 -1 -1], i = 1, j=1 :: H(i,j,R)= 0.0036+0.0000j
------------------------------------------------------------

#### Downfolding from Siesta LCAO Hamiltonian.
We take SrMnO$_3$ cubic structure as an example (The files can be found in example/Siesta/SrMnO3_SOC directory.) 
Durint the siesta SCF calculation, we need the following parameters to save the Hamiltonian and the overlap matrices. 
```
SaveHS  True
CDF.Save True
SaveHS True
```
After running siesta, we can proceed.

==NOTE== We use [sisl](http://zerothi.github.io/sisl/docs/latest/index.html) to load the siesta outputs. It need to be installed before you follow the example.
```
pip install sisl
```

We write a python script similar to the example above. The difference is that we read the siesta output instead of Wannier, by specifying the path and the name of the fdf file. A extra parameter spin can be specified. For non-polarized and spin-orbit calculation, it should be set to None. For collinear spin calculation, spin=0 or 1 gives the up and down channel of the band structure. 

```
downfolder = SislDownfolder(folder='.', fdf_file='siesta.fdf', spin=None)
```

In this example, spin-orbit coupling is activated in the siesta calculation. We build the Mn 4 $e_g$ band with spinor wavefunctions.  We can select four anchor points. 

```
        anchors={(.0, .0, 0): [46, 47, 48, 49]},
```

We get the following band downfolding result.
